  "longDescription": "Seamlessly integrate App Store Connect and Firebase Crashlytics into your Claude Code workflow. This plugin provides comprehensive automation for iOS build management, dSYM downloads, and crash symbolication.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**App Store Connect Integration:** Query apps, monitor builds, check status, and download dSYM files with pure Swift implementationâ€”no Ruby, Fastlane, or CocoaPods required.\n\n**Firebase Crashlytics Support:** Automated dSYM uploads from App Store Connect, Xcode archives, or local paths. Streamline crash symbolication workflows.\n\n**Workflow Automation:** Four slash commands automate common tasks: download latest dSYMs, upload to Crashlytics, check build status, and interactive credential setup.\n\n**Expert Agent:** The ios-crash-manager agent specializes in crash symbolication troubleshooting, dSYM management, and multi-step automation workflows.\n\n**Pure Swift:** Built with Swift 6.0, actor-based concurrency, and modern async/await patterns. Thread-safe, performant, and maintainable.\n\n**Security First:** Credentials stored securely in Claude Code configuration. Private keys never leave your machine. All sensitive data redacted from logs.\n\n**Use Cases:** Perfect for iOS developers managing TestFlight builds, debugging production crashes, automating CI/CD dSYM workflows, and monitoring App Store submissions.",
